## 💡 Features

Infinite Memory Chat provides several key features to enhance your chatting experience:

- **Self-Populating Memory:** The chatbot remembers past interactions by saving them. This allows for a more natural conversation flow.
- **Vector Store Archive:** All conversations get archived to ensure nothing is lost. You can always return to previous chats.
- **Easy to Use Interface:** You don’t need technical skills to use this application; it’s designed for everyone.

- **Memory:** At least 4 GB of RAM
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 200 MB available space
- **Internet Connection:** Required for accessing the OpenAI API

## ✨ How It Works

The application avoids common limitations found in standard chatbots. Here’s a simple breakdown of its process:

1. **Active Conversation Level:** Initially, the chatbot can remember the latest 20 messages. This ensures you have context for ongoing discussions.
2. **Archiving Old Conversations:** Once the limit is reached, the oldest 10 messages are archived into the vector store, freeing up space for new interactions.
3. **Long-Term Memory:** All past conversations are stored, allowing the chatbot to respond based on your previous topics and queries.

## 🌐 Using OpenAI's Responses API

Infinite Memory Chat connects to OpenAI's Responses API to provide smart and relevant answers. The more you interact, the better it learns your interests and preferences, which enhances the relevance of its responses.
